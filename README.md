This is the client-side React SPA application.
## Project Structure

### `assets`

CSS, images, and vendor libraries.

### `layout`

Components used in the general layout of the application.

### `models`

Data structures used in the application.

### `pages`

Components used for the content pages of the application.

### `services`

Classes for interacting with server-side functionality.

## TODO

Considering that the origins of this application were used as a test bed for me to learn React, there are improvements that can be made.  In particular I don't like how I'm currently referencing vendor code.  Rather than tinker with it piece by piece, ultimately I'd like to re-write the entire application from scratch with a whole new design.  It's mostly a matter of finding a good website design template with no library dependencies.
